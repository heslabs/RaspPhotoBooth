# Google App Password

### 2-Step Verification (2FA)

To enable 2-Step Verification (2FA) and create an app password, first, go to your Google Account's security settings and enable 2-Step Verification. After this, you can navigate back to the Security section to find and enable the App Passwords option. You will then be able to generate a 16-character app password for a specific app by entering its name and clicking "Create". 

#### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification (2FA)

1. Go to your Google Account: Open your web browser and go to your account settings at accounts.google.com. 

2. Select Security: From the navigation panel on the left, click on Security. 

3.  Find 2-Step Verification: Under the "How you sign in to Google" section, click on 2-Step Verification. 

4. Turn it on: Click Get started and follow the on-screen instructions to add a phone number or another verification method to enable 2-Step Verification.

#### Step 2: Generate an App Password

1. Go back to Security: Once 2-Step Verification is enabled, return to your Google Account's Security page. 

2. Access App Passwords: Scroll down to find the App passwords option and click on it. You may need to sign in again to verify your identity. 


3. Generate the password: In the "App Password" section, enter the name of the app (e.g., "Outlook," "Saleshandy") for which you need the password in the "Select app" field. 

4. Click Create: Click the Create button. A 16-character app password will be displayed. 

5. Copy and save: Copy this 16-character password and paste it into a secure, safe place, such as a password manager or notepad. You will not be able to view it again. 

#### Step 3: Use the App Password 

* When you encounter a prompt to sign in to an app or device that doesn't support modern sign-in methods (like security keys or passkeys), you will use the generated app password instead of your regular Google Account password.
